    VisualCrust (http://www.visualearth.org/globalcrust10/crust10web/visualcrust10.html) is a web application developed with the Google Earth web browser plug-in and its JavaScript API. The purpose of this web application is to disseminate and visualize the KML-formatted global crustal structure (from the CRUST 1.0 model) on the Google Earth virtual globe over the Internet. Any computer, which already has the Google Earth web plug-in installed, can freely visit this webpage on a decent broadband connection.
